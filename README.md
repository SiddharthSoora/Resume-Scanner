# Resume-Scanner
The resume scanner ranks a candidate for a given role based on the education, experience and other information obtained on his or her resume.

## Description

It is a form of pattern matching between a job’s descriptions or requirements and the qualification of a candidate based on their resume. The main aim of ranking resumes is to decide whether to move a candidate forward – usually onto an interview or to reject them.
